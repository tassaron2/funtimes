SUMMARY
--
FUNTIMES is a text-adventure game where you assume the role of a teenager living the longest day ever. During this day you'll have to do many tasks to gain weet points. These weet points are a representation of how "weet" you are -- weetness being the ultimate measure of one's awesomeness. You get weet points by doing weet things like finding a girlfriend, posting on forums, helping people out, etc. -- just be awesome and the game will do the rest of the work.

The game would be rated PG-13 if it went through the MPAA, for mild swearing, some sexuality, petty crime, and drug use. Don't play the game at all if any of these things offend you.
